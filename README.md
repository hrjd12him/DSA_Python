# DSA_Python 🧠🐍

This repository contains a **complete and structured implementation of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in Python**, built from scratch with a learning-first approach.

I have covered **all core DSA concepts**, and for **each concept, multiple questions are solved** to build strong problem-solving intuition.  
The repository also includes **solutions to multiple LeetCode problems**, implemented using optimal approaches wherever possible.

---

## 📌 What This Repository Covers

- Core **Data Structures**
- Fundamental & advanced **Algorithms**
- Multiple problems per concept (easy → medium → hard)
- Clean, readable Python implementations
- Interview-oriented problem solving
- Real LeetCode questions solved using DSA concepts

## 🧪 Problem Solving Approach

For every problem:

- Clear understanding of the problem
- Optimal time & space complexity
- Edge cases handled
- Pythonic and readable code
- Interview-ready logic

Most problems are inspired by:

- **LeetCode**
- **Coding interview patterns**
- **Classic DSA questions**
